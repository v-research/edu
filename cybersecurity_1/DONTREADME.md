If you do not agree, please don't play.
If you spend your time playing this game, you will hack
the questions of the next exam but, by hacking them, you will prove yourself you know
the answers to those questions. I just give you a more complex way to answer them with a game.
I believe the understanding of cybersecurity (and of anything else) should not be weighted
with a score. You are not a cucumber, nor is your knowledge. But if you share the answers 
to others, you won't allow them to learn. As Nietzsche famously wrote in the Zarathustra (On the Pitying):

"Indeed, I do not like them, the merciful who are blissful in their pitying: they lack too much in shame.
If I must be pitying, then I certainly do not want to be called such [...]
Gladly would I cover my head and flee before I am recognized, and thus I bid you do as well, my friends!
[...] For inasmuch I saw the sufferer suffering, I was ashamed for the sake of his shame; and when I helped him I severely violated his pride.
[...] beggars should be abolish completely! Indeed one is angered in giving and angered in not giving.
And the same for sinners and bad consciences!
[...] But if you have a suffering friend, then be a resting place to his suffering, yet at the same time a hard bed, a camp bed: thus you will be most useful to him.
And if a friend does evil to you [Ed. by not following the rules above], then say: 'I forgive you what you have done to me; but that you did it to yourself - how could I forgive that!'"
